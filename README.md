#Etwist
Simple Twitter-esque Social Webpage

This is a project made for my college. It was abaout making a Social Nework webpage using Laravel as BackEnd and Reactjs as Front End. The result is a look similar to the one from Twitter, using similar shapes and colors.

This project lets the user connect to a MySQL Database and create Users, Profiles, Posts. The main menu lets registered users make posts using text or images/gifs. This is done thanks to IMGBB Api that lets the user host images and auto generate a link to that image.
